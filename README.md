A custom WordPress theme built with Vue, Vuex and Vue-Router

## Description

Just a fun WordPress theme I built using Vue.js.  This was the first time I was using Vue and I wanted to use it with WordPress.  Obviously there are different ways to do that, but I chose to package it just like a normal WordPress theme.  My reason for this was to have one application instead of having a separate WordPress theme and a separate Vue app.  I can still build my theme out by extending the WordPress core functionality and render what I want from the API with Vue on the front-end.  There is a lot of room for improvement all over the place, especially with the state management. 

## Getting Started

npm install
```
### Development
